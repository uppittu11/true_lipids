# true_lipids

An example of a TRUE workflow for a biological system {insert DOI}. 

This example walks through the setup and simulation of a lipid bilayer consisting of ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol, which are the three main lipid components of the stratum corneum. All input files and results are reproducible by executing the workflow. In addition, the scripts are highly modular, allowing for the extension of this study to simulate different lipid types, compositions, and/or water content. 

To get started open up the main notebook by executing the following command in the terminal:
```bash
jupyter-notebook workflow/true_lipids.ipynb
```
